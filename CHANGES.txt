*8.0.01 (18-JUL-2018)*
 * fixed - GetCurrentMapAreaID() and GetMapNameByID() are no longer valid API calls, replaced with C_Map.GetBestMapForUnit() and C_Map.GetMapInfo(). Remapped all zones to new mapIDs.
 * removed - Any reference to Artifact Power rewards, as they no longer exist
 * added - Wakening Essences are now available as a reward, and can be viewed as a total
 * added - The Argussian Reach would like to apologize for not allowing their quests to be marked "Always show". This has been rectified.
